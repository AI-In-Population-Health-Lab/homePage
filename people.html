                        <p>Yuhe Gao was a data scientist in our lab. She received her B.S. in Geographic Information Science from the University of Cincinnati
                           and East China Normal University (2+2 program) in 2020, and further achieved her M.S. in
                           Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh in 2022. She is currently working as a data
                           scientist in this lab and also in the Department of Biomedical Informatics. Her undergraduate
                           studies focused on environmental quality, while her graduate studies delved into disease
                           research. With the current and future experience working on various patient cohorts and EHR
                           data, she is interested in combining her knowledge of GIS and biomedical informatics to improve
                           the sensitivity of clinical data and develop insights at multiple levels, including the geographic level. 
                           Yuhe has been admitted to the PhD progam at Department of Computer Science, Emory University.
